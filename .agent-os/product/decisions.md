## 2025-08-01: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner

### Decision

Create "What's That Color?" - a gameshow-style web game where players describe random hex colors and receive AI-powered scores based on humor, accuracy, and popularity. The game will be single-player, endless, and focus on creative expression over competition.

### Context

The casual gaming market lacks creative expression opportunities, with most games focusing on skill, speed, or matching mechanics. There's an opportunity to combine color perception with creative writing, using AI to provide subjective feedback that traditional games cannot offer. The gameshow theme provides an entertaining framework that makes the experience feel like participating in a TV show.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Multiplayer Competitive Version**
   - Pros: Social engagement, competitive scoring, viral potential
   - Cons: Requires user accounts, moderation, complex matchmaking, reduces accessibility

2. **Educational Color Theory Focus**
   - Pros: Learning value, potential institutional sales, measurable outcomes
   - Cons: Less entertaining, academic feel reduces broad appeal, limits creative freedom

3. **Simple Color Matching Game**
   - Pros: Easier to build, clear success metrics, established game pattern
   - Cons: Commoditized market, lacks creative expression, limited engagement depth

### Rationale

The single-player creative approach maximizes accessibility while providing unique value. AI scoring enables subjective evaluation that human-designed games cannot achieve. The gameshow theme differentiates from both educational tools and traditional casual games, creating a unique market position.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Unique market positioning combining creativity and AI
- High accessibility with no learning curve or account requirements  
- Scalable AI-powered content that doesn't require manual curation
- Strong viral potential through shareable creative descriptions

**Negative:**
- AI API costs scale with usage and may require monetization
- Success depends on AI scoring quality and user perception of fairness
- Limited competitive/social elements may reduce retention vs multiplayer games

## 2025-08-01: AI Scoring Service Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead

### Decision

Use OpenAI GPT-4 as the primary AI scoring service for evaluating color descriptions on humor, accuracy, and popularity criteria.

### Context

The core value proposition depends on intelligent, nuanced scoring that considers subjective qualities like humor while maintaining consistency. Multiple AI services are available with different cost structures, capabilities, and reliability profiles.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Local Language Models**
   - Pros: No API costs, offline capability, full control
   - Cons: Requires significant compute resources, lower quality scoring, complex deployment

2. **Anthropic Claude**
   - Pros: Strong reasoning capabilities, good safety features
   - Cons: Higher costs, fewer optimization tools, less community support

3. **Custom Scoring Algorithm**
   - Pros: Predictable costs, full control, fast responses
   - Cons: Cannot evaluate humor or creativity effectively, limited sophistication

### Rationale

GPT-4 provides the best balance of scoring quality, API maturity, and cost predictability. OpenAI's established developer ecosystem and extensive prompt engineering resources reduce implementation risk. The ability to evaluate subjective qualities like humor is critical to the game's value proposition.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- High-quality, nuanced scoring that can evaluate creativity and humor
- Mature API with good documentation and community support
- Ability to fine-tune prompts for optimal scoring behavior
- Strong reliability and uptime track record

**Negative:**
- Variable API costs that scale with usage
- Dependency on external service for core functionality
- Potential latency issues affecting game responsiveness
- Need for fallback scoring system when API is unavailable

## 2025-08-02: Firebase Removal and localStorage Architecture

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Developer

### Decision

Remove Firebase/Firestore completely and implement a localStorage-only architecture for data persistence using Zustand persist middleware.

### Context

After implementing Firebase integration, it became clear that the complexity and overhead were not justified for a single-player game. Firebase added significant bundle size (112KB), required external configuration, and introduced potential costs and failure points without providing essential value for the core user experience.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Keep Firebase with Optimizations**
   - Pros: Cross-device sync, cloud backup, analytics capabilities
   - Cons: Added complexity, bundle size, costs, external dependencies, overkill for local game

2. **Hybrid Approach (localStorage + Firebase)**
   - Pros: Best of both worlds, graceful degradation
   - Cons: Increased complexity, duplicate code paths, synchronization issues

3. **IndexedDB Implementation**
   - Pros: More storage capacity than localStorage, better performance
   - Cons: More complex API, unnecessary for simple color history data

### Rationale

For a creative single-player game, local storage provides all necessary functionality while maximizing simplicity, performance, and reliability. The 112KB bundle size reduction improves load times, and eliminating Firebase removes external dependencies and potential costs. User data privacy is enhanced since no data leaves the device.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- 112KB bundle size reduction (296KB â†’ 184KB total)
- Simplified architecture with no external dependencies
- Improved privacy - no data transmitted to external services
- Faster loading and better performance
- No Firebase costs or configuration complexity
- Full offline functionality by design

**Negative:**
- No cross-device synchronization
- Data lost if user clears browser data
- No centralized analytics on user behavior
- Limited to browser storage quotas (though adequate for use case)
