## Implementation Summary

All tasks completed successfully! The dual color gradient mode is fully integrated:
- ✅ State management with mode persistence
- ✅ Dual color generation with minimum color distance
- ✅ Mode toggle button with animations
- ✅ Gradient display with proper 33%-33%-33% layout
- ✅ AI and fallback scoring for dual colors
- ✅ History support for both single and dual modes
- ✅ Build successful with no errors

**Next Steps:**
Test in browser at http://localhost:3001 to verify:
1. Mode toggle switches between single and dual modes
2. Gradient displays correctly in dual mode
3. Descriptions are scored for both colors
4. Mode persists on page refresh
5. History shows gradient swatches for dual entries
