## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**ColorGenerator Utility**
- Generates valid 6-digit hex colors
- Colors are properly formatted with # prefix
- No duplicate colors in sequence (statistical check)
- Edge case handling for random number generation

**ScoringEngine Utility**
- Funny score calculation with various input types
- Accuracy score algorithm with known color mappings
- Popularity score balancing common vs unique terms
- Overall score combination and rounding logic
- Input sanitization and validation

**GameState Store (Zustand)**
- Initial state setup and default values
- Color update triggers proper state changes
- Description submission updates scores correctly
- Game loop transitions maintain state integrity

### Integration Tests

**Game Flow Integration**
- Complete game cycle: color → description → scoring → new color
- Form submission triggers score calculation and display
- State updates propagate correctly to all components
- Error states handled gracefully (invalid input, scoring failures)

**Component Integration**
- ColorDisplay updates when game state changes
- DescriptionInput validates and submits correctly
- ScoreDisplay shows accurate ratings from state
- Responsive layout works across different screen sizes

### Feature Tests

**End-to-End Game Play**
- User can see random color on game load
- User can type description and submit successfully
- User receives star rating feedback immediately
- User can continue to next color seamlessly
- Game works on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports

**Input Validation Scenarios**
- Empty description submission shows appropriate feedback
- Extremely long descriptions are handled correctly
- Special characters and emojis don't break scoring
- Rapid submissions don't cause race conditions

### Mocking Requirements

**Random Number Generation**
- Mock Math.random() for predictable color generation in tests
- Use deterministic seeds for reproducible test scenarios

**Scoring Algorithm**
- Create known input/output pairs for regression testing
- Mock complex scoring logic during component testing

**Timer Functions**
- Mock setTimeout/setInterval for game loop timing tests
- Control timing-dependent animations and transitions

## Performance Tests

**Rendering Performance**
- Color transitions complete within 200ms
- Star rating animations don't block user input
- Component re-renders are minimized during state updates

**Memory Management**
- No memory leaks during extended gameplay sessions
- Proper cleanup of event listeners and timers
- State history doesn't grow unbounded

## Accessibility Tests

**Keyboard Navigation**
- Tab order follows logical flow through interface
- Enter key submits descriptions from text input
- Focus indicators are visible and clear

**Screen Reader Support**
- Color values are announced to screen readers
- Score results are properly communicated
- Game state changes provide appropriate feedback

**Visual Accessibility**
- Sufficient color contrast for text overlays
- Star ratings work without color dependency
- Text remains readable across all generated colors
