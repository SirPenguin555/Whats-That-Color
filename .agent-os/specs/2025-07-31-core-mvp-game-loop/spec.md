> Spec: Core MVP Game Loop
> Created: 2025-07-31
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement the foundational game mechanics for "What's That Color?" including random color generation, player text input, basic scoring system, and continuous game loop functionality. This creates the core user experience where players can describe colors and receive immediate feedback.

## User Stories

### Primary Game Flow

As a casual gamer, I want to see a random color and describe it in my own words, so that I can exercise creativity and receive entertaining feedback.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Player opens the game and immediately sees a full-screen random hex color
2. Player types their creative description in a text input field at the bottom
3. Player submits their description and receives a star rating (0-5 to tenths)
4. A new random color automatically appears and the process repeats

### Immediate Feedback Loop

As a creative person, I want to receive instant scoring on my color descriptions, so that I stay engaged and motivated to continue playing.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. After submitting a description, the system evaluates it on 3 criteria
2. Player sees individual scores for funny, accurate, and popular
3. An overall star rating is displayed prominently
4. The game immediately transitions to the next color for continuous play

## Spec Scope

1. **Random Hex Color Generator** - Generate and display full-screen random hex colors with proper contrast
2. **Text Input System** - Capture player descriptions with validation and submit functionality  
3. **Basic Scoring Algorithm** - Evaluate descriptions on humor, accuracy, and popularity using simple rules
4. **Star Rating Display** - Show 0-5 star ratings with decimal precision in engaging visual format
5. **Game Loop Controller** - Manage transitions between colors and maintain game state
6. **Responsive Layout** - Ensure functionality works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
7. **Input Validation** - Prevent empty submissions and handle edge cases gracefully

## Out of Scope

- AI-powered scoring (reserved for Phase 2)
- Game history persistence (reserved for Phase 4)
- Gameshow animations and visual polish (reserved for Phase 3)
- User accounts or authentication
- Sound effects or audio feedback
- Social sharing functionality

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Game Loop** - Players can continuously describe colors and receive scores without interruption
2. **Responsive Web Interface** - Game works seamlessly across all device sizes and orientations
3. **Basic Scoring Feedback** - Players receive meaningful 3-category scores that feel fair and engaging
