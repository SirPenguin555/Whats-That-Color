# Tests Specification

This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-31-ai-powered-scoring/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-31
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**AI Scoring Service**
- Prompt generation with various color/description combinations
- Response parsing for valid JSON responses
- Error handling for malformed API responses
- Score validation (0-5 range, decimal precision)
- Timeout handling and retry logic

**Caching System**
- Cache key generation consistency
- Cache hit/miss logic
- LRU eviction when cache size limit reached
- Cache expiration handling (24-hour TTL)
- localStorage fallback when unavailable

**Fallback Logic**
- Automatic fallback when AI service fails
- Fallback scoring produces valid results
- Graceful degradation without user disruption
- Error logging for monitoring

### Integration Tests

**API Route Testing**
- POST /api/score-description endpoint functionality
- Request validation (description, hexColor required)
- Response format validation
- Error response handling (4xx, 5xx status codes)
- Rate limiting behavior

**OpenAI API Integration**
- Successful API requests with valid responses
- Authentication with API key
- Rate limiting handling (429 responses)
- Network error recovery
- Response parsing for various GPT-4 outputs

### Feature Tests

**End-to-End AI Scoring**
- Player submits description and receives AI-generated scores
- Loading states display during API processing
- Scores appear with proper animations and formatting
- Fallback scoring works when AI is unavailable
- Game continues seamlessly regardless of scoring method

**Performance Testing**
- Response times within acceptable ranges (2-5s for AI, <100ms for fallback)
- Cache performance (sub-50ms for cache hits)
- Memory usage doesn't grow unbounded with caching
- No memory leaks during extended gameplay

### Mocking Requirements

**OpenAI API Responses**
- Mock successful GPT-4 responses with valid JSON scores
- Mock various error scenarios (network, rate limiting, invalid responses)
- Mock response delays to test loading states
- Mock different score ranges to test edge cases

**Environment Variables**
- Mock OPENAI_API_KEY for testing without real API calls
- Test environment variable validation and error handling

**localStorage**
- Mock localStorage for caching tests
- Test cache behavior when localStorage is unavailable

## Error Scenario Tests

**Network Failures**
- API request timeout handling
- Connection refused errors
- DNS resolution failures
- Intermittent network issues

**API Response Errors**
- Invalid JSON responses from GPT-4
- Missing score fields in responses
- Scores outside valid range (0-5)
- Rate limiting and quota exceeded errors

**Edge Cases**
- Empty or whitespace-only descriptions
- Extremely long descriptions (200+ characters)
- Special characters and emojis in descriptions
- Invalid hex color values
- Rapid successive API requests

## Performance Benchmarks

**Response Time Targets**
- 95th percentile cache hits: < 50ms
- 95th percentile AI responses: < 5 seconds
- 95th percentile fallback responses: < 100ms

**Reliability Targets**
- API success rate: > 95%
- Fallback activation rate: < 5%
- Zero game-breaking errors from scoring failures

**Cost Monitoring**
- Track tokens per request
- Monitor daily/weekly API costs
- Alert if costs exceed budget thresholds
