# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: AI-Powered Scoring System
> Created: 2025-07-31
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Replace the basic scoring algorithm with OpenAI GPT-4 powered evaluation to provide intelligent, nuanced scoring of player color descriptions based on humor, accuracy, and popularity criteria.

## User Stories

### Intelligent Humor Evaluation

As a creative player, I want my funny color descriptions to be properly recognized and scored by AI, so that I receive accurate feedback on my comedic creativity.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Player submits a humorous description like "angry grape having an existential crisis"
2. GPT-4 evaluates the humor based on creativity, wordplay, and comedic timing
3. Player receives a humor score that reflects actual comedic value rather than keyword matching
4. Scores feel fair and encourage continued creative expression

### Accurate Color Assessment 

As a player focused on precision, I want the AI to properly evaluate color accuracy beyond basic color name matching, so that nuanced color descriptions are rewarded appropriately.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Player submits accurate descriptions like "deep royal purple with blue undertones"
2. GPT-4 analyzes the description against the actual hex color value
3. AI considers color theory, shade precision, and visual accuracy
4. Player receives accuracy scores that reflect true color knowledge

### Contextual Popularity Scoring

As a player seeking the sweet spot between unique and understandable, I want AI to evaluate whether my descriptions strike the right balance, so that I'm rewarded for creative but accessible language.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Player submits descriptions ranging from common to highly creative
2. GPT-4 evaluates uniqueness vs comprehensibility balance
3. AI considers cultural context and linguistic accessibility
4. Player receives popularity scores that encourage creative but relatable descriptions

## Spec Scope

1. **OpenAI API Integration** - Connect to GPT-4 API with proper authentication and error handling
2. **Intelligent Scoring Prompts** - Design prompts that consistently evaluate humor, accuracy, and popularity
3. **Response Processing** - Parse AI responses and convert to 0-5 decimal scores
4. **Fallback System** - Gracefully handle API failures by falling back to basic scoring
5. **Loading States** - Show appropriate feedback during AI processing time
6. **Cost Optimization** - Implement request caching to minimize API costs
7. **Score Consistency** - Ensure AI scores feel fair and predictable to players

## Out of Scope

- Multiple AI providers (focus on OpenAI only)
- Real-time streaming responses (single request/response only)
- Advanced prompt fine-tuning (basic prompt optimization only)
- User-specific AI learning (stateless evaluation only)
- Detailed AI explanation feedback (scores only, no reasoning)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Intelligent AI Scoring** - Players receive sophisticated evaluation that recognizes humor, creativity, and accuracy
2. **Reliable Performance** - System handles API failures gracefully without breaking gameplay
3. **Improved Player Experience** - Scoring feels more engaging and fair compared to basic algorithm
